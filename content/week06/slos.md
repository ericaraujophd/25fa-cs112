## SLOs for Week 06: Linked Lists, Dynamic Array or Linked List

At the end of this unit, the student will be able to...

- describe the organization of a linked list â€” how Nodes are chained together.
- reason about the time complexity of the typical operations: prepend, append, remove, traverse, searching, indexing, etc.
- explain how the Node destructor causes a chain reaction to delete all Nodes in the list.
- write code to walk through the linked list.
- compare and contrast the strengths and weaknesses of a linked list vs. a dynamic array.
