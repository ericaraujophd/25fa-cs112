# Vectors — Dynamic Arrays

## SLOs for Week 04: Vectors — Dynamic Arrays

Students will be able to...

- recognize a copy constructor and implement it.
- identify the 3 situations in which a copy constructor is called
- reason about the difference between a **shallow** and **deep** copy of a data structure.
- use the **new** operator to dynamically allocate memory and the **delete** and **delete\[\]** operators to free up the memory.
- explain when C++ calls the destructor on an object.
- explain when it is important to implement the destructor explicitly for a class.
- understand the implementation of a dynamic array data structure, including how it adapts its internal size to accommodate the number of values in the array.
- implement operator overloading for a class.
