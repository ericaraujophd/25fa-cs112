## SLOs for Week 11: BSTs

At the end of this unit, students will be able to...

- articulate the operations one can do on a Binary Search Tree.
- understand the implementation of a BST and the algorithms for `insert`, `contains()`, `remove()`, `getHeight()`, the destructor, and the various traversals.
- reason about the complexity of operations on a BST -- for best and worst cases.
- describe the algorithm for finding the maximum node in a left subtree and minimum node in a right subtree, for use during the `remove()` algorithm.
- define what makes a BST **balanced**.
- AVL trees:
  - identify an AVL tree as a self-balancing tree.
  - articulate the importance of the balance factor in determining when the tree needs to be rebalanced.
  - compute the balance factor for a node.
