# SLOs, Slides, and Assignments for Week 10

## SLOs for Week 10: Recursion

By the end of this unit, the student will be able to:

- describe recursion correctly to an elderly ancestor.
- define the structure of a recursive solution -- base case and recursive case.
- correctly use the words "winding phase" and "unwinding phase".
- implement a basic recursive implementation -- e.g., for the factorial function.
- argue why a recursive solution is generally less efficient than an equivalent iterative solution.
- describe the role the runtime stack plays in the execution of a recursive function.
- understand the time complexity of the Towers of Hanoi problem.
