# Week 13

## SLOs for Week 13: STL set and map containers

At the end of this unit, students will be able to...

- describe the unique characteristics of the STL set container -- e.g., that a set stores unique values in sorted order.
- describe the time complexity of set container operations, like find, insert, remove.
- write code using iterators to traverse all items in a set.
- explain the behavior of an iterator.
- describe the unique characteristics of the STL map container -- e.g., that a map stores key, value pairs, with unique keys stored in sorted order.
- describe the time complexity of map container operations, like find, insert, remove, and indexing/subscripting.
- reason about the unique behavior of indexing in a map object.
- write code using iterators to traverse all items in a map.
