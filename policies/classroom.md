# Classroom Policy

```{danger}
No phones, no laptops, unless we tell you you can.
```

This is a difficult class, and you don't need to be distracted by goofing around on your phone or laptop. And, I don't want you to distract others.

**Daily Quizzes** will be administered in the first 5 minutes of class, on Moodle. **Do not show up late** to class.

## Attendance

Class attendance is optional.

Also, lab attendance **is required**! Lab is not optional. Skipping lab may result in you doing poorly in class.

**Missing class due to illness**: if you are going to miss class due to (physical or mental) illness, please send me an email **before** class.

## Disabilities

Calvin University is committed to providing access to all students. If you are a student with a documented disability, please notify a Disability Coordinator in Student Success (located in Hiemenga Hall 227) to discuss necessary accommodations. If you have an accommodation memo, please come talk to me in the first two weeks of class. 

If you are a student needing reasonable modifications for pregnancy and related conditions, please contact the Title IX Coordinator in Student Life (located in Spoelhof University Center 364).

## Statement of Diversity and Inclusion

Inside and outside of the classroom, I work to treat every person with equal respect, regardless of racial identity, gender identity, physicality, brain chemistry, nationality, political leanings, and religious background. 

Whoever you are, you are fearfully and wonderfully made. God delights in diversity and I do, too. We humans need diverse viewpoints because every viewpoint, on its own, has blind spots. That has been proven to be true in technology-related fields, where under-represented minorities are significantly under-represented in the working world. When companies work hard to rectify this, they find their products and services improve. We have found this to be true in Computer Science classrooms as well.

```{warning}
If you or someone else in this class is hurt by something I say or do in class, I would like to know about it so that we can work toward a remedy. This has happened in the past in my classroom -- usually when I'm trying to be "cool" or be funny. If this happens this semester, please know that it was unintentional. Because this kind of feedback can be uncomfortable for all involved, Iâ€™ll take it however it comes: in public or in private, on the spot or days later, directly from you or indirectly through another student, another professor, or through my department chair Keith VanderLinden (kvlinden\@calvin.edu).
