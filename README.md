# CS 112 - Data Structures

Fall 2025

## Course Overview

An intermediate programming course focusing on fundamental data structures and algorithms using C++. Students will learn to design, implement, and analyze efficient data structures and algorithms.

This repository contains the course materials built as a Jupyter Book website.

## Topics Covered

- Introduction to C++ (compilation, data types, pointers, arrays)
- Control Structures and Functions
- File I/O and Exception Handling
- Classes and Operator Overloading
- Vectors and Dynamic Arrays
- Generic Containers
- Linked Lists and Dynamic Data Structures
- Algorithm Analysis and Big-O Notation
- Stacks and Queues
- Recursion
- Binary Search Trees (BSTs)
- AVL Trees
- STL set and map containers
- Hash Tables and Sorting Algorithms

## Prerequisites

- CS 111 or equivalent programming experience in C++
- Understanding of basic programming concepts

## Programming Language

**C++** - All assignments and projects will be implemented in C++

## Course Structure

The course is organized into weekly modules (Week 0-14) plus a final exam period. Each week includes:
- Student Learning Objectives (SLOs)
- Readings and resources
- Laboratory assignments
- Programming projects
- Periodic tests

## Assessment

| Component | Weight |
|-----------|--------|
| Laboratory Assignments | 30% |
| Programming Projects | 35% |
| Tests (4 tests) | 30% |
| Class Participation | 5% |

### Test Schedule

- Test 1: Weeks 0-2 (Friday)
- Test 2: Weeks 0-5 (Friday)

## Building the Course Website

This course website is built using Jupyter Book. To build and preview the site locally:

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7+
- pip

### Installation
```bash
pip install jupyter-book
```

### Building the Book
```bash
# Build the book
jupyter-book build .

# Clean previous builds (if needed)
jupyter-book clean .
```

### Preview the Site
After building, open `_build/html/index.html` in your web browser to preview the site locally.

### Publishing
The site can be published to GitHub Pages or other hosting platforms. See the [Jupyter Book documentation](https://jupyterbook.org/publish/gh-pages.html) for deployment instructions.
